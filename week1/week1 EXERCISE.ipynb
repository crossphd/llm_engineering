       "Let's break down the provided code snippet and understand its purpose and functionality. \n",
       "\n",
       "### Code Breakdown\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Components Explained:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Set Comprehension**: \n",
       "   - `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` \n",
       "   - This part of the code creates a **set** of authors by iterating through a collection called `books`. \n",
       "   - The `book.get(\"author\")` expression tries to retrieve the value associated with the key `\"author\"` from each `book` dictionary.\n",
       "   - The `if book.get(\"author\")` condition ensures that only books with a non-`None` or non-falsy author value are included in the set. If `book.get(\"author\")` returns `None` or an empty string (or any other false-like value), that book will be excluded from the set.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Set Generation**: \n",
       "   - The use of curly braces `{}` indicates that a set is being created. A set is a collection of unique elements. Hence, the result will contain only unique author names (no duplicates).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **`yield from` Statement**: \n",
       "   - `yield from` is a construct used in Python to yield all values from an iterable. This enables the function to return each element produced by the set comprehension one at a time to the caller of the generator function.\n",
       "   - It essentially turns this expression into a generator that produces authors one by one.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Purpose \n",
       "\n",
       "The entire line of code is used within a generator function to yield the unique authors of books present in the `books` collection that have a valid author name. Here's why you might use this construct:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Memory efficiency**: Since it uses `yield from`, the authors will be generated one by one, rather than all at once, which can be memory-efficient, especially with large datasets.\n",
       "- **Unique values**: By using a set comprehension, it automatically filters out any duplicate author names, resulting in a set of unique authors without manual checking for duplicates.\n",
       "- **Filtering**: It effectively filters out any books that do not have an author, ensuring that only valid authors are yielded.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example\n",
       "\n",
       "Assuming `books` is defined as follows:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "books = [\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 1\", \"author\": \"Author A\"},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 2\", \"author\": \"Author B\"},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 3\", \"author\": None},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 4\", \"author\": \"Author A\"},  # Duplicate author\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 5\", \"author\": \"\"},\n",
       "]\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "The resulting unique authors yielded would be:\n",
       "\n",
       "- \"Author A\"\n",
       "- \"Author B\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So, the code effectively filters out books without authors and ensures no duplicates when delivering the author names."

       "\n",
       "This is a generator expression in Python, written using the **Yield From syntax**.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of what each part does:\n",
       "\n",
       "* `yield from`: This keyword is used to invoke another iterator and create an iterable sequence.\n",
       "* `{...}`: This defines a dictionary comprehension. However, this specific code doesn't use the resulting dictionary values but instead yields values directly.\n",
       "* `book.get(\"author\")`: For each book in `books`, it tries to retrieve the value of the \"author\" key from the book dictionary and yields that value.\n",
       "* The expression is wrapped within `.get()` calls for each book, which means only books with the \"author\" key will be included in the iteration.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why**\n",
       "\n",
       "This code is using a few concepts:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Generator Expression**: Instead of storing all the yielded values in memory at once (like a list comprehension), this expression creates an iterator that produces values on-the-fly. This can be more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
       "2. **Yield From syntax**: By using `yield from`, the generator becomes a delegator. It doesn't need to store all the yielded values, it just delegates them to another iterable (the one defined within the `.get()` calls).\n",
       "3. **Dictionary Comprehension**: Although not necessary in this case, dictionary comprehensions can be useful when you need to perform some computation on each book's dictionary and still want the resulting dictionary.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example Context**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a potential example where this code might appear:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "books = [\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 1\", \"author\": \"Author 1\"},\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"Book 2\", \"author\": \"Author 2\"},\n",
       "    # ...\n",
       "]\n",
       "\n",
       "authors = {}  # Dictionary to store authors\n",
       "\n",
       "for book in books if book.get(\"author\"):\n",
       "    author = book.get(\"author\")\n",
       "    authors[author] = book.get(\"title\") or None  # Optional title fetching\n",
       "\n",
       "# Here, authors is a dictionary with books by their authors\n",
       "\n",
       "# The yield from expression can be chained like this:\n",
       "filtered_books_by_authors = {}\n",
       "yield from {book for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "filtered_books_by_authors = filtered_books_by_authors\n",

       "**Notes**\n",

We pass in the `headers` dictionary we defined earlier. The response is stored in the `response` variable, but we don't actually need this variable for anything.\n",
       "*   We extract the HTML content of the webpage from the `response.content` attribute (this can be a byte array or string depending on how the content was encoded) using BeautifulSoup's HTML parser (`html.parser`).
